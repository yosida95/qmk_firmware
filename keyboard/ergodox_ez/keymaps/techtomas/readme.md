# Techtomas Configuration

## Base Layer

The base layer is a merge of what I liked with the default layout and the ordinary layout. The thumb cluster is more like the Kinesis advantage and the top row of the cluster is convient for use on the mac.

* The Caps Lock postion handles [Hyper/Esc](http://brettterpstra.com/2012/12/08/a-useful-caps-lock-key/)
* The Tab key toggles MEH.
* The two vertical mods on the left board are Shift+Tab and Tab.
* The two vertical mods on the right board are Control Layer tap/toggle and Alt+Cmd.
* The HYPER and MEH key are made in the same location on the right side of the board as well. Using Keyboard Maestro for OS X makes one-handed shortcuts very easy.

## Symbol Layer
The symbol layer can be tap/toggled through the bottom right key and also toggled holding the tilde/grave key in the upper left corner. I haven't used the symbol layer enough to tell if this was a good place or not but it made sense in my head

The bottom two vertical mods are set to F14 and F15 which is the default for changing screen brightness on the mac

## Media Layer
/ & ; will toggle the media layer which has play and volume controls assigned to the thumb cluster. I found this an easy way to quickly play/pause

## Control Layer
The a and z keys toggle the control layer.

On the left board you have mouse control with left & right click in the location of the G and B keys.
On the right board you have vim-style arrow keys using hjkl

The thumb cluster and mods all pass down to this layer.
