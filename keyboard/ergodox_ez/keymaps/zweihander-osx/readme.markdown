# The Zweihander Layout

NB: the backtick (\`) is special in Markdown. If I write ⌘\` in this readme, I mean “command-backtick”, not “command-backslash-backtick”.

This layout is tuned for people who…


## use OS X

This layout doesn’t make any concessions for Windows use. While it should work fine in Windows, I’m not about to devote precious keyboard space to Windows-specific shortcuts.


## mouse left-handed while doing other things with the right hand

I tend to have my mouse in my left hand, but I like to use my other hand to make things go faster. I’ve added a bunch of buttons to the media layer to speed up browsing in Safari and Finder:

- Close Window (⌘W)
- Back (⌘[)
- Forward (⌘])
- Open and Close Parent Folder (⌥⌘↓)
- Go Up and Close Just-Left Folder (⌥⌘↑)
- Cycle through open windows in current application (⌘\` and ⌘⇧\`)
- Cycle through tabs in current window (⌥⇥ and ⌥⇧⇥)
- Space (page down in browsers; Quick Look in the Finder)
- Shift-Space (page up in web browsers)

Because moving letter-by-letter is way slower than moving word-by-word, I added Option (⌥) to the bottommost button on the left side. This key can be held easily while holding ; (activate media layer) and pressing J and L to move left and right by word.


## use lots of modifier keys in OS X menu-item shortcuts

I wanted to preserve the feel of a number of shortcuts that involve pressing lots of modifier keys at once; this is why the bottom left of the keyboard has shift, control, option, and command in the usual spaces. Further, some common shortcuts I press have a key on the right side of the keyboard. These shortcuts include:

- Empty Trash Without Asking for Confirmation (⇧⌥⌘⌫)
- Shut Down Without Asking for Confirmation (⇧⌥⌘ power)


## use Emacs-style shortcuts

I press C-a, C-e, and C-k all the time. It’s difficult to press these key combinations with the control key on the bottom left and I’m too quick on the draw for the control function on the / key to work reliably, so the bottommost thumb button on the right side is another control key.


## use spreadsheets

All the common spreadsheet operations (+-*/=) are now on the right side of the symbol layer.
